# Chat AI Backend

This is the backend for the **Chat AI** application, built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **TypeScript**. It uses **Stream** for chat functionality, message history, and user management. A **PostgreSQL** database hosted on **Neon** is used to store user data and chat logs, with **Drizzle ORM** handling database interactions. The AI responses are powered by **OpenAI**.
